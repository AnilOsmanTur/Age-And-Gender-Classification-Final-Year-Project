# Age-And-Gender-Classification-Final-Year-Project-
Age and Gender Classification

● Goal is predict Age and Gender of Human by using Deep Learning.

● Python programming language was used for developing.

● Theano, Caffe, TensorFlow and Keras were used for building the neural network with GPU Computing.

● The estimated accuracy value obtained is over 80%.

● The heavy work of the Convolutional Neural Network was made on the Server and the result was served to the mobile client

● This removes the heavy workload on the client

● The trained Convolution structure and weights are shared on GitHub.
